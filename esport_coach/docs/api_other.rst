Database
########

**Postgres**

PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system. It is
fully compatible with Django. The main reason Postgres was used in this project
is because the database is store in the cloud instead of a local copy like MySQL
did. It make our team access the database with ease, and very convenient.
